  <h2>Supporting You Every Step of the Way</h2>
  <p>
    At Maternity Payment Guide, our mission is simple: empower parents with easy-to-understand, reliable tools that help make financial planning during maternity leave less stressful. We know how overwhelming it can be to decipher complex benefits or HR policies—especially when preparing to welcome a new member to the family.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why we built this platform—to give parents a free and trustworthy way to calculate their expected maternity pay. Whether you're employed, self-employed, or somewhere in between, our tools are designed to be user-friendly, accurate, and accessible.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're not a large corporation. We're a small team passionate about helping families thrive. We continuously update our information and improve our tools based on feedback from users like you. It’s not just about numbers—it’s about peace of mind.
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ To simplify complex maternity policies</li>
    <li>✔ To provide privacy-focused, no-signup calculations</li>
    <li>✔ To make planning less stressful for growing families</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Built by Real People, for Real Families</h3>
  <p>
    Our platform was created by people who understand the challenges of maternity leave and budgeting. We strive to offer clarity when it's needed most—and we do it without ads, subscriptions, or data collection. Just fast, accurate estimates to help you plan with confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
